  /* anytime you add padding to any element, that padding will stretch the page, so for example lets say you have a page that is 100% of the view ports width so if you add the padding to something it will make the width more than 100% so it would force a horizontal scroll bar. So what border-box does it prevents that from happening because it prevents padding from adding extra width or extra heigth to the page.

        it is the full height of the entire  window that you are in
        so 100vh means we always want to stretch the background at least the full height of the screen even if the content isnt enought to take the full content of the screen
